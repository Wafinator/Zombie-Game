# IMPORTANT

If using the Intellij IDE, download all the files and make sure to create a new project, then create 5 new java classes named ZombieGame, Zombie, Player, Game,and Speed, then copy paste the github code from each respective class into the newly created classes. Then drag the images folder to the project folder/directory. Finally run the ZombieGame.java for the project to work. As far as im aware, all other ide's should be fine but the only other ide I tested was dr.java and that worked ok, but if something goes wrong let me know asap.
